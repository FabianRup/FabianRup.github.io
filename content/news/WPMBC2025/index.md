I was lucky to have another conference right at my doorstep! **The West Pacific Marine Biology Network** had its 3rd meeting at the University of Queensland in Brisbane. Indigenous people and scientists from Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Kiribati, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand all shared their insights from basic research to climate change-induced challenges.

This gave me the opportunity to talk about [Dolittle](/projects/dolittle) *for the first time time*. During the conference it became clear that glycosylation plays a fundamental role in marine processes and climate change related issues. Communication, symbiosis, defence, temperature resilience - everything connected to and carried out by glycans.
