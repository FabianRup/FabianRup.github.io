abstract: A hallmark of animals is the coordination of whole-body movement. Neurons and muscles are central to this, yet coordinated movements also exist in sponges that lack these cell types. Sponges are sessile animals with a complex canal system for filter-feeding. They undergo whole-body movements resembling “contractions” that lead to canal closure and water expulsion. Here, we combine live 3D optical coherence microscopy, pharmacology, and functional proteomics to elucidate the sequence and detail of shape changes, the tissues and molecular physiology involved, and the control of these movements. Morphometric analysis and targeted perturbation suggest that the movement is driven by the relaxation of actomyosin stress fibers in epithelial canal cells, which leads to whole-body deflation via collapse of the incurrent and expansion of the excurrent canal system. Thermal proteome profiling and quantitative phosphoproteomics confirm the control of cellular relaxation by an Akt/NO/PKG/PKA pathway. Agitation-induced deflation leads to differential phosphorylation of proteins forming epithelial cell junctions, implying their mechanosensitive role. Unexpectedly, untargeted metabolomics detect a concomitant decrease in antioxidant molecules during deflation, reflecting an increase in reactive oxygen species. Together with the secretion of proteinases, cytokines, and granulin, this indicates an inflammation-like state of the deflating sponge reminiscent of vascular endothelial cells experiencing oscillatory shear stress. These results suggest the conservation of an ancient relaxant-inflammatory response of perturbed fluid-carrying systems in animals and offer a possible mechanism for whole-body coordination through diffusible paracrine signals and mechanotransduction.
