I am a molecular biologist/biochemist and postdoctoral researcher at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. My research lies at the intersection of functional proteomics and evolutionary biology, with a particular focus on how proteins and their post-translational modifications have evolved to shape key animal traits. Using mass spectrometry as my main analytical tool, I study early-branching animals such as sponges, ctenophores, and cnidarians to uncover the post-translational innovations underlying the emergence of multicellularity, the nervous and immune systems, and symbiotic interactions.

Please reach out for potential collaborations or peer-review requests.
