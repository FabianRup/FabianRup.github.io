I am a molecular biologist/biochemist and postdoctoral researcher at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. My research lies at the intersection of functional proteomics and evolutionary biology, with a particular focus on how proteins and their post-translational modifications have evolved to shape key animal traits. Using mass spectrometry as my main analytical tool, I study early-branching animals such as sponges, ctenophores, and cnidarians to uncover the molecular innovations underlying the emergence of multicellularity, the nervous and immune systems, and symbiotic interactions.

Please reach out for potential collaborations or peer-review requests.
